# **INSY7314 – Interactive Web App Development** 🚀

Welcome to **INSY7314**, where you’ll learn to design, build, and secure modern web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  

---

## 📖 What Is This Module?  
INSY7314 guides you through full‑stack development and security best practices. 
You’ll start by spinning up a NoSQL database, then build a robust, RESTful API, add HTTPS encryption, and finally craft a dynamic React frontend. 
Along the way, you’ll apply key security controls to keep your users’ data safe.

---

## 🎯 Why We’re Doing This  
- **Hands‑On Skills**: Practice real‑world workflows by building each layer of a MERN app.  
- **Security Mindset**: Learn to harden your code and infrastructure against common web threats.  
- **Industry Relevance**: MERN is widely used in startups and enterprises—mastering it boosts your employability.
